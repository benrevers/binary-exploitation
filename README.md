## return-to-libc
Return-to-libc is the next evolution of buffer overflow after the stack memory space has been set to non-executable. In an effort to better understand exactly how the stack changes during the attack I sketched out each step. Note: This assumes no ASLR or StackGuard and 32-bit architechture.
